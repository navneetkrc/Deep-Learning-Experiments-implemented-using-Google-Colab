It highlights the empirical success of residual networks, particularly their performance on the ImageNet dataset and their foundational role in winning multiple competitions in 2015.\\nDeep Residual Learning for Image Recognition\\nKaiming He\\nXiangyu Zhang\\nShaoqing Ren\\nJian Sun\\nMicrosoft Research\\n{kahe, v-xiangz, v-shren, jiansun}@microsoft.com\\nAbstract\\nDeeper neural networks are more difﬁcult to train. We\\npresent a residual learning framework to ease the training\\nof networks that are substantially deeper than those used\\npreviously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learn-\\ning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, in-\\nstead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide com-\\nprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual\\nnetworks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from\\nconsiderably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we\\nevaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers—8×\\ndeeper than VGG nets [41] but still having lower complex-\\nity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error\\non the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the\\nILSVRC 2015 classiﬁcation task. We also present analysis\\non CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers.\\nThe depth of representations is of central importance\\nfor many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our ex-\\ntremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative im-\\nprovement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep\\nresidual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC\\n& COCO 2015 competitions1, where we also won the 1st\\nplaces on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet local-\\nization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.\\n1. Introduction\\nDeep convolutional neural networks [22, 21] have led\\nto a series of breakthroughs for image classiﬁcation [21,\\n50, 40]. Deep networks naturally integrate low/mid/high-\\nlevel features [50] and classiﬁers in an end-to-end multi-\\nlayer fashion, and the “levels” of features can be enriched\\nby the number of stacked layers (depth). Recent evidence\\n[41, 44] reveals that network depth is of crucial importance,\\nand the leading results [41, 44, 13, 16] on the challenging\\nImageNet dataset [36] all exploit “very deep” [41] models,\\nwith a depth of sixteen [41] to thirty [16]. Many other non-\\ntrivial visual recognition tasks [8, 12, 7, 32, 27] have also\\n1http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2015/\\nand\\nhttp://mscoco.org/dataset/#detections-challenge2015.\\n0\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n0 \\n10\\n20\\niter.

A neural network can be trained and improved with each example, but the larger the neural network, the more examples it needs to perform well—often needing millions or billions of examples in the case of deep learning.

CNNs are designed to process data with a grid-like topology, such as images, and they utilize a unique architecture that distinguishes them from traditional ANNs.\n\n### Key Features of CNNs:\n\n1. **Three-Dimensional Neuron Organization**: \n   - In CNNs, neurons are organized in three dimensions: height, width, and depth. This structure allows CNNs to capture spatial hierarchies in images, where the depth dimension corresponds to the number of channels (e.g., RGB for color images).\n\n2. **Layer Types**:\n   - CNNs are composed of three main types of layers:\n     - **Convolutional Layers**: These layers apply convolution operations to the input, allowing the network to learn spatial hierarchies and features from the images. Each neuron in a convolutional layer connects to a small region of the input, which helps in detecting local patterns.\n     - **Pooling Layers**: These layers reduce the spatial dimensions of the input, helping to decrease the computational load and control overfitting by summarizing the features.\n     - **Fully-Connected Layers**: These layers connect every neuron in one layer to every neuron in the next layer, typically used at the end of the network to produce the final output.\n\n3. **Functionality**:\n   - The input layer holds the pixel values of the image, while the convolutional layers compute outputs based on local regions of the input. The pooling layers then condense these outputs, and the fully-connected layers produce the final classification scores.\n\n4. **Learning Paradigms**:\n   - CNNs primarily utilize supervised learning, where the model is trained on labeled data to minimize classification errors. This is crucial for tasks such as image classification, where the goal is to correctly identify the class of an input image.\n\n5. **Architectural Design**:\n   - A common practice in CNN architecture is to stack multiple convolutional layers before pooling layers. This enhances feature extraction capabilities and allows the network to learn more complex patterns.\n\n6. **Resource Intensity**:\n   - CNNs can be resource-intensive, especially when processing large images. Techniques such as zero-padding and careful management of layer dimensions are often employed to optimize performance and memory usage.\n\nIn summary, CNNs are a powerful tool in the field of machine learning, particularly for image analysis and pattern recognition, leveraging their unique architecture to effectively learn and classify visual data."

Here are the key advantages of ResNets over standard CNNs:\n\n1. **Degradation Problem Mitigation**: Traditional CNNs often face the degradation problem, where increasing the depth of the network leads to higher training error. ResNets address this issue by introducing shortcut connections that allow gradients to flow more easily during backpropagation. This makes it easier to optimize deeper networks, as the residual learning framework allows the model to learn residual mappings instead of the original unreferenced mappings.\n\n2. **Higher Accuracy with Increased Depth**: ResNets can be significantly deeper than traditional CNNs without suffering from performance degradation. For instance, ResNet architectures with 50, 101, or even 152 layers have been shown to achieve better accuracy compared to shallower networks. The empirical results demonstrate that deeper ResNets can produce substantially better results on datasets like ImageNet and CIFAR-10.\n\n3. **Generalization Performance**: ResNets exhibit good generalization performance across various recognition tasks. The context mentions that replacing VGG-16 with ResNet-101 in the Faster R-CNN framework led to a notable increase in detection metrics on challenging datasets like COCO, indicating that ResNets can generalize better to unseen data.\n\n4. **Architectural Efficiency**: Despite being deeper, ResNets maintain lower computational complexity compared to traditional architectures like VGG-16. For example, a 152-layer ResNet has lower complexity (11.3 billion FLOPs) than VGG-16 (15.3 billion FLOPs), allowing for more efficient training and inference.\n\n5. **Empirical Success in Competitions**: ResNets have achieved top rankings in various competitions, such as ILSVRC and COCO 2015, demonstrating their effectiveness in real-world applications. The context highlights that models based on deep residual networks won first places in several tracks, showcasing their superior performance.\n\nIn summary, ResNets improve upon traditional CNNs by effectively addressing the degradation problem, enabling deeper architectures to be trained successfully, achieving higher accuracy, and demonstrating strong generalization capabilities across different tasks."

The input is a 1D sequence of these token embeddings.\n   - **Vision Transformers (ViT)**: ViT adapts the Transformer architecture for image classification tasks by treating image patches as tokens. An image is divided into fixed-size patches, which are then flattened and linearly embedded into a sequence. This sequence of patch embeddings is fed into the Transformer, similar to how word embeddings are processed in NLP.\n\n2. **Architecture**:\n   - **Transformers**: The standard Transformer architecture consists of layers of multi-headed self-attention and feed-forward neural networks, designed to capture relationships and dependencies in sequential data.\n   - **Vision Transformers (ViT)**: While ViT retains the core Transformer architecture, it modifies the input to accommodate 2D image data. The model includes additional components such as position embeddings to retain spatial information about the patches, which is crucial for understanding the structure of images.\n\n3. **Performance and Efficiency**:\n   - **Transformers**: In NLP, Transformers have become the standard due to their ability to scale and perform well on large datasets, often requiring significant computational resources.\n   - **Vision Transformers (ViT)**: ViT has shown that a pure Transformer can achieve competitive results in image classification, often outperforming traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in terms of efficiency and scalability when pre-trained on large datasets. ViT requires substantially fewer computational resources to train compared to state-of-the-art CNNs, making it a promising alternative for image recognition tasks.\n\nIn summary, while both architectures utilize the Transformer framework, Vision Transformers adapt the input and processing methods to effectively handle image data, demonstrating significant advantages in performance and resource efficiency in the realm of computer vision."

Unlike recurrent layers, which require sequential processing, self-attention can process all input positions simultaneously. This leads to faster training times and more efficient use of computational resources.\n\n2. **Learning Long-Range Dependencies**: One of the key advantages of self-attention is its ability to learn long-range dependencies within the input data. In traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs), the path length between input and output positions can be long, making it difficult to learn relationships between distant elements. Self-attention, on the other hand, connects all positions with a constant number of sequential operations, facilitating the learning of these long-range dependencies.\n\n3. **Computational Complexity**: The computational complexity of self-attention is O(n² · d), where n is the sequence length and d is the representation dimension. This is more efficient than recurrent layers, which have a complexity of O(n · d²). This efficiency becomes particularly beneficial as the sequence length increases.\n\n4. **Flexibility in Input Representation**: Self-attention allows for flexible input representations, as it can weigh the importance of different parts of the input dynamically. This is particularly useful in tasks where the relevance of input elements can vary significantly.\n\n5. **Application in Vision Transformers**: In the context of Vision Transformers (ViT), self-attention mechanisms have been adapted to process images by applying attention to patches of the image rather than individual pixels. This adaptation allows transformers to achieve state-of-the-art results in image recognition tasks, demonstrating the versatility and effectiveness of self-attention beyond traditional NLP applications.\n\nOverall, self-attention enhances the transformer's ability to process data efficiently and effectively, making it a foundational component of the architecture."

Here’s a detailed explanation of how it works:\n\n### Key Concepts of ResNet\n\n1. **Residual Mapping**:\n   - Instead of learning the desired underlying mapping \\( H(x) \\) directly, ResNets focus on learning a residual mapping \\( F(x) = H(x) - x \\). This means that the network learns the difference between the desired output and the input, which is often easier to optimize.\n\n2. **Shortcut Connections**:\n   - ResNets utilize shortcut connections that skip one or more layers. These connections perform identity mapping, allowing the input \\( x \\) to be added directly to the output of the stacked layers. This can be mathematically represented as:\n     \\[\n     H(x) = F(x) + x\n     \\]\n   - The addition of the input \\( x \\) helps in mitigating the vanishing gradient problem, making it easier for the network to learn.\n\n3. **Optimization Benefits**:\n   - The formulation of \\( F(x) + x \\) allows the network to push the residual \\( F(x) \\) towards zero if the identity mapping is optimal. This is generally easier than fitting a complex mapping directly, especially as the depth of the network increases.\n\n### Architecture\n\n- ResNets can be constructed with various depths, such as 18, 34, 50, 101, and even 152 layers. The architecture includes:\n  - **Convolutional Layers**: These layers extract features from the input images.\n  - **Batch Normalization**: Applied after each convolution to stabilize and accelerate training.\n  - **Pooling Layers**: Used for down-sampling the feature maps.\n  - **Fully Connected Layers**: At the end of the network for classification tasks.\n\n### Performance\n\n- ResNets have shown significant improvements in accuracy as the depth increases, unlike traditional plain networks, which suffer from higher training errors with increased depth. For instance, a 34-layer ResNet outperforms an 18-layer ResNet, demonstrating that deeper networks can be effectively trained without degradation in performance.\n\n### Empirical Results\n\n- Extensive experiments on datasets like ImageNet and CIFAR-10 have validated the effectiveness of ResNets. They have achieved state-of-the-art results, including winning the ILSVRC 2015 competition with a 152-layer ResNet, which had lower complexity than previous models like VGG-16/19.\n\nIn summary, ResNets leverage residual learning and shortcut connections to facilitate the training of very deep networks, overcoming the optimization difficulties that typically arise with increased depth. This architecture has proven to be highly effective in various image recognition tasks."
